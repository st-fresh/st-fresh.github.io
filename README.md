This repo currently respents work completed at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Tallahassee, FL,

In order to not publicly publish this work I have made access to the .html files encrypted (passcode required),
 
This means you must contact me to obtain a passcode (passcodes are given for good-reason and typically to people I know in real life).

Proposed:
Update index.html on root with material-ui and foundation
Add next project (choose wisely)
